## Toll-Management-System

This project is a web-based Toll Management System designed to simulate a toll booth queue using the concept of a queue in data structures. It allows users to manage vehicles entering a toll queue, set queue capacity and toll amounts, and track total earnings and the number of vehicles processed.

## Features
1. **Queue Capacity and Toll Setup:** Allows the user to set the queue capacity and toll amount. These are fixed once set.
2. **Vehicle Management:** Users can add vehicles to the queue, process vehicles through the toll, and reset the queue for a new session.
3. **Real-time Queue Display:** Displays all vehicles currently in the queue.
4. **Statistics Tracking:** Tracks the total number of vehicles processed and the total earnings from toll charges.
